I made a script to be able to download songs sending a request to a telegram bot. You need to have youtube-dl installed for it to work, and it works with Python3.

For example 
/song lissszzzzzt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Dvg2MxQn8
Will send you lissszzzzzt.mp3

Reasons is because I want to download music, but not use my phone all the time because I hate it. So now you have Youtube link and you'll send the command with the title, forget about it and finally retrieve it. Also I like automating stuff.
